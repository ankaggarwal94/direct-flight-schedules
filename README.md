# direct-flight-schedules
This repo is meant to use data about nonstop flights (defined as flights with "nonstop service," which go directly from Point A to the destination Point B, unlike direct flights, which may make intermediate stops). The data will be scraped from Wikipedia and possibly any IATA public API's. The purpose is to indulge my curiosity about strange nonstop flight routes (e.g. https://news.airtreks.com/9-obscure-long-haul-flights/) and determine how they were affected by COVID.
